# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality systems.
Software engineering is crucial for designing, developing and maintaining reliable, efficient and scalable systems that meet user needs and drive technological innovation

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The development of programming language e.g fortran, C
2. The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
3. The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements, which involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
2. Design, which involves xreating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation, which involves writing code and building software according to the design specifications
4. Testing, which involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment, which involves releasing the software to users
6. Maintainance, which involves providing ongoing support, dates and enhancements to the software after deployment

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. A software developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solution
2. A quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans
3. A project manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivering of software projects
   
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs, provide comprehensive tools for writing for writing, debugging and testing code e.g Vs code, Eclipse
2. VCS, they are tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, Subversion
   
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Changing requirements, Technical debts, tight deadlines
2. They can overcome these challegies through effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, regular assessments of project goals and timelines

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Unit testing, testing of individual components or modules of software.
2. Integration, testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3. System, testing the entire software system as a whole.
4. Acceptance, testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting your questions or instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from your robot or AI assistant. It helps make questions clear, specific so that AI understands exactly what i need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example tell me about africans, Al will give me a general answer about all africans, but if i say tell me about Zimbabwean Nguni people it will give me the specific answer for that certain tribe.
